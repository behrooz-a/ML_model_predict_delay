This Jupyter Notebook is designed to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an invoice payment will be delayed. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps. The primary goal is to create an optimized model that can accurately predict payment delays based on various invoice-related features.
Since I do not have permission, I cannot share the data.
Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
Numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels xgboost scikit-learn

Two data set are reqired, train and test to run this file. Due to the premission they have not been shared here.

•	Load the training dataset (train.csv).  
•	Load the test dataset (test.csv) and preprocess it similarly to the training data.



Usage
1.	Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2.	Load the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
3.	Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4.	Use the trained model to predict payment delays on new data.

A piece of extra information has been provided as a PDF file for the reader (Overview)
